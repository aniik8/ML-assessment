"""
You have access to every studentâ€™s marks in every quiz. The marks are stored in a matrix
where matrix[i][j] represents the marks of the ith student in the jth quiz.
The instructor wants you to sort the marks of students according to jth quiz in increasing
order
 so that he can evaluate the performance of students in that particular quiz.
Here, you have to create a python program using which the instructor 
can sort the data on
the basis of a given column(quiz). The program will return the 
matrix with the marks sorted in
jth quiz.
The dimension of the input matrix is mxn, the output is expected 
to be a 2d numpy matrix of
dimension mxn, but in the output the jth column must be arranged 
in the ascending order.
